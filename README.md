#### Proxima | By Vitzual ####

This is an open source bot that is being developed for Proxima Studios. You are allowed to use any code you
find here for your own projects.

To contribute to the bot, do the following...

1. Create a fork of the repository
2. Add / make changes in the fork you created
3. Submit the changes through a pull request

All pull requests will be reviewed before being accepted, and it is highly recommended that you check in
with me before making any contributions, as a feature may already be in development.

Some features of the bot aren't open source, these include...

- The bot token
- User / project databases

If you have any further questions, dm me on discord.
